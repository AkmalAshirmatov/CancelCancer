# CancelCancer

The purpose of this project is to mitigate doctor's task to segment various malignant tumors on human's skin.

We use neural net named as UNet for image segmentation. Furthermore, sequential neural net was trained on labeled dataset of 9 types of skin tumors for 30 epochs and achieved almost 80% of accuracy on test dataset.
